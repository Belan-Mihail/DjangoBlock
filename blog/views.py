# So we'll type "comments =", we're  
# able to get the comments from our post, we'll  filter them to view only those that are approved.
# And we're going to order them this time  in ascending order, so that we have the

# we'll set the boolean to true, otherwise it  will remain false. So we'll say "liked = false"  
# and then we'll check with an if statement here, 
# to see if our post  
# when we filter it out if the user id is actually  there to say that they've liked the post.
# If they are, we'll set it to true,  otherwise it will remain false.

# Then we'll create a dictionary here to supply  our context. So our post will be simply post,

# So let's get that: if comment_form.is_valid():
# And what we're going to do is  set our email and our username  
# automatically from the logged in user.
# This is conveniently passed in as part  
# of the request so that we can  get those details from there.
# So we'll set the email to the request.user email.
# We'll set the instance name  to the request username.
# And then, we're going to call  the save method on our form  
# but we're not actually going to  commit it to the database yet.
# The reason is that we want to first assign a  post to it. So comment.post equals our post instance,  
# so that we know which post a comment has  been left on and then we can save it.
# We'll add an else clause here as  well, because if the form is not valid  
# then we just want to return an  empty comment form instance. So:
# else: comment_form = CommentForm()
